Homework for the fourteenth lesson

There is a file with document numbers.  
The document number is a string consisting of letters and numbers (no service characters).  
This file contains each document number on a new line and no other information in the line, only the document number.  
A valid document number must be 15 characters long and start with the sequence docnum (followed by any sequence of letters/digits) or soptgast (followed by any sequence of letters/digits).  
A program is written to read information from the input file - the path to the input file is set through the console.  
The program checks document numbers for validity.  
Valid docnum document numbers are written to one report file.  
Valid contract numbers soptgast are written to another report file.  
Errors, if any, are written to the error_log.txt  
file Logs are written to the file execution_log.txt  
Invalid document numbers are written to another report file, but after the document numbers there is added information about why this document is invalid   
(wrong sequence of characters at the beginning / there are service characters in the document name and other).
